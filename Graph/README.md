# Graph Learning Repository

Welcome to my Graph Theory and Algorithms learning repository! This space documents my journey in understanding and implementing graph concepts and algorithms.

## What is a Graph?

A graph is a data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. It's used to represent relationships between objects and is fundamental in solving many real-world problems.
